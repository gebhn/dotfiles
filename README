Dotfiles
________________________________________________________________________________

A collection of configurations for my Alpine Linux installation, running on a
Framework 13 AMD 7040 series laptop. Includes configurations for Sway, Neovim,
Foot, Ash, and likely some other environmental bloat like shell scripts.

[001] Dependencies
________________________________________________________________________________

Naturally as these are dotfiles there are several programs which are required in
order to utilize their configuration. While the inclusion of this list is
probably self-evident to anyone who is perusing dotfile repos on GitHub, they'll
still be listed here.

* Ash    [https://git.busybox.net/busybox]
* Foot   [https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot]
* Neovim [https://github.com/neovim/neovim]
* Sway   [https://github.com/swaywm/sway]

[002] Warnings
________________________________________________________________________________

The Neovim configuration specifically assumes you are building from the Nightly
release and therefore certain features may not work with the stable builds.
