Dotfiles

A collection of configurations for my Alpine Linux installation, running on a
Framework 13 AMD 7040 series laptop. Includes configurations for Sway, Mako,
Neovim, Foot, Ash, and likely some other environmental bloat like shell scripts.

[001] Dependencies
________________________________________________________________________________

Naturally as these are dotfiles there are several programs which are required in
order to utilize their configuration. While the inclusion of this list is
probably self-evident to anyone who is perusing dotfile repos on GitHub, they'll
still be listed here.

* Ash    [https://git.busybox.net/busybox]
* Foot   [https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot]
* Mako   [https://github.com/emersion/mako]
* Neovim [https://github.com/neovim/neovim]
* Sway   [https://github.com/swaywm/sway]
* Tmux   [https://github.com/tmux/tmux]

|   User service are services that run as the specific user they belong to.    |
|   Starting with version 0.60, OpenRC has support for user services.          |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To configure user services, you must first create the default runlevel service
which enables lingering services for the target user. Afterwards, copy the
contents of the .config/sv/ directory to /etc/user/init.d/ and enable the
services which you wish to use.

[003] Warnings

The Neovim configuration specifically assumes you are building from master and 
therefore certain features may not work with the stable builds.
