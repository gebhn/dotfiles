A collection of configurations for my Alpine Linux installation, running on a
Framework 13 AMD 7040 series laptop. Includes configurations for Sway, Neovim,
Foot, BusyBox Ash, and likely some other environmental bloat like shell scripts.

Warnings
________________________________________________________________________________

The Neovim configuration specifically assumes you are building from the Nightly
release and therefore certain features may not work with the stable builds.
